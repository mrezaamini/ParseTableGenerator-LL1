# ParseTableGenerator-LL1
Sipmle version of a LL1 top down parser that extract all the terminals and non-terminals based on the given grammar. This program calculate first and follow sets off each non-terminals and then creates Right Hand Side Table (RHST) of the grammar. At the end with computing predicts for each non-terminal it will make the parse table for each terminal and prints all the process.

## Notes:
1. Program contains a function that checks being nullable for all the terminals and non-terminals
1. Grammar.txt is the input grammar to the program
1. In grammar use # as epsilon (for declaring the nullable concept)
1. In grammar use capital letters for non-terminals
1. Click OK (left button)
1. Wait for the results
